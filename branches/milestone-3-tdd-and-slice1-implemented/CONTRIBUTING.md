# CONTRIBUTING.md
_Last updated: 2026-01-02_

Thanks for helping improve the workshop ❤️

## What to contribute
High value contributions:
- clearer instructions (especially self-paced)
- better prompts (less drift, smaller diffs, more tests-first)
- improvements to `scripts/checkpoint.sh`
- additional challenge cards
- bug fixes in the sample app/tests
- workshop facilitation tips

## How to contribute
1) Fork the repo
2) Create a branch:
   - `docs/<topic>` for documentation
   - `feat/<topic>` for new workshop features
   - `fix/<topic>` for bug fixes
3) Make your change (keep diffs small)
4) Run:
   - `bash scripts/checkpoint.sh final` (if applicable)
5) Open a PR with:
   - what changed and why
   - how you tested it
   - any screenshots or logs if relevant

## Style guidelines
- Prefer simple language; avoid jargon
- Keep instructions copy/paste friendly
- If you add a new lab, also add a prompt file and (if possible) a checkpoint check

## Code of conduct
Be kind. Assume good intent. Help people learn.
