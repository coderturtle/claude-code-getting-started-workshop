# scratch/ — Temporary working notes
_Last updated: 2026-01-02_

This folder is for **ephemeral** notes generated during agentic work.

## Rules
- Anything in here can be deleted.
- If a note becomes durable, move its content into the correct home:
  - `WORKSHOP.md` / `SELF-PACED.md` / `labs/` / `prompts/` / `adrs/`
- Keep this folder tidy. The `repo-hygienist` agent should prune it regularly.

## Tip
If Claude starts creating lots of markdown files, direct it to write to `scratch/` first,
then consolidate intentionally.
