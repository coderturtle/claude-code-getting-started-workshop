Interview me with 12–18 clarifying questions (with follow-ups until unambiguous).
Then write SPEC.md with:
- Goal / non-goals
- User stories
- API endpoints
- Data model (ADR markdown + naming)
- Error cases (incl. traversal and invalid input)
- Test plan
- Acceptance criteria

Do NOT write any code yet. Only write SPEC.md.
