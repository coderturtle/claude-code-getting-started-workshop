Act only as repo-hygienist.

Task: perform a hygiene sweep of this repo.
1) Inventory: list markdown files created/modified recently (focus on new/untracked).
2) Classify each: KEEP / CONSOLIDATE / MOVE / DELETE.
3) For CONSOLIDATE: specify the target file and exact sections to merge.
4) For MOVE: specify destination path (labs/, prompts/, adrs/, scratch/).
5) For DELETE: justify briefly.
6) Then propose the smallest set of file changes to implement the cleanup (touch as few files as possible).

Constraints:
- Prefer one authoritative SPEC.md and one PLAN-SLICE.md.
- Keep scratch notes only if still needed; otherwise delete.
- Update README / SELF-PACED navigation if paths change.
Do not implement changes until I approve the plan.
