Act only as tdd-coach.

We are about to implement Slice 1. Apply the tdd-red-green Skill.

First: produce a short list of 3–5 behaviors we will implement, in order.
For each behavior, state:
- the test file to add/update
- the key assertion
- the endpoint or function being implemented

Do NOT write production code yet. Only the plan and test list.
