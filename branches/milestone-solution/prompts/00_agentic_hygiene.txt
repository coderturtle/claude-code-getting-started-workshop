You are my repo hygiene assistant.

Rules for this session:
- Do NOT create new markdown files unless I explicitly ask, OR you justify it as durable workshop documentation.
- Prefer updating existing files over creating new ones.
- Use `scratch/` for temporary notes and drafts.
- If you create anything in `scratch/`, mark it TEMPORARY at the top.
- Keep only: SPEC.md, PLAN-SLICE.md, ADRs in adrs/, and the workshop docs structure.
- When you finish a task, propose a quick “hygiene sweep” to consolidate or delete anything unnecessary.

Acknowledge these rules in 3 bullets, then wait.
