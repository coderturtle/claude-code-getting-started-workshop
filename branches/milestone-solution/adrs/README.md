# adrs/ — Architecture Decision Records
_Last updated: 2026-01-02_

ADRs are durable, git-friendly records of important decisions.

## Why this helps agentic development
- Forces explicit decisions (reduces “implicit architecture”)
- Provides stable context for agents and humans
- Makes tradeoffs reviewable and auditable

## Conventions
- File: `ADR-XXXX-short-title.md`
- YAML frontmatter: `id, title, status, date`
- Sections: Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives
