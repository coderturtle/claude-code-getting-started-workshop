# Lab 07 — Retro & apply to a real repo
**Goal:** turn workshop learning into a reusable habit.

## Retro questions
1) What belonged in `CLAUDE.md`?
2) What became a Skill (or should become one)?
3) What guardrail would you want in a real team repo tomorrow?
4) What “small diff” rule will you adopt?

## Final verification
```bash
bash scripts/checkpoint.sh final
```

## Optional: share
Post your best Skill in your team channel or copy it into a shared folder.

### Hygiene sweep (if Claude created extra docs)
Run: `prompts/00_hygiene_sweep.txt` and keep the repo tidy.
