Use PLAN-SLICE.md to implement Slice 1.
Rules:
- Use strict **Red → Green → Refactor**. For each behavior: write a failing test, run pytest (red), implement minimal code, run pytest (green).
- Start in Plan Mode: propose a small plan + file list; wait for approval.
- Tests first (or at least in the same step).
- Keep diffs small; no refactors.
- Run pytest after each step and fix failures.

Implement:
- GET /health
- POST /adrs (writes markdown under adrs/)
- GET /adrs (lists ADRs)

End by updating README with minimal curl examples.


Tip: If you drift, switch to `tdd-coach` and use `prompts/03b_tdd_step_driver.txt`.
