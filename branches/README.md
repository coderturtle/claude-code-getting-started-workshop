# branches/ — Maintainer milestone snapshots (temporary)
_Last updated: 2026-01-02_

This folder is **maintainer-only**. It contains snapshot directories used to create git tags/branches for “resume from checkpoint” workflows.

It will not be part of the final learner repo.

## What changed in these snapshots
These snapshots are regenerated to reflect:
- the latest `CLAUDE.md` guidance (introduced progressively across milestones)
- new modules (Agentic Hygiene, TDD)
- new agents and skills
- module READMEs and improved documentation map

## Creating tags/branches
Use:
- `branches/README.md` (instructions)
- `branches/QUICK-COMMANDS.md` (one-shot loop)

If you publish this repo publicly, remove the entire `branches/` folder.
