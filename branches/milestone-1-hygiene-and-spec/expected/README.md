# expected/ — Reference examples (not full solutions)
_Last updated: 2026-01-02_

This folder contains example outputs (SPEC, slice plan, ADR format).

## Why this helps agentic development
- Gives learners an “anchor” for what good looks like
- Avoids full solution spoilers
- Makes self-paced progress less frustrating

Use it to compare structure and completeness, not to copy/paste verbatim.
